THIS IS VERY BAD ATM. 
THIS IS VERY BAD ATM. 




possible way to organise resources / things to include
rough layout of each section??

books
lectures/videos
sort by topic
research papers
patents
other repos (other awesomes)
communities
uni courses


also seperate by complexity??
so for example, in cache design, order in terms of difficulty
or 2 seperate repos.
one organised as a sort of tutorial, another as an index.




layout




idea:
create a list of resources for each topic (CPU/GPU/compiler/FPGA)
each topic has resources for books, lectures, papers etc.
each topic also has a tutorial/guide, which gives you some resources to get you to a certain level of competancy
afterwards which you can just consult the index/patents/research papers

example for CPU you have resources
also a guide.md that takes you from single cycle risc-v to OoO superscalar CPU
